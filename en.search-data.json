Practice with multiple cases to become familiar with the end-to-end modeling process. Main topics include:\nUnderstand related concepts such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistical Machine Learning; Learn the principles of common algorithms. Focus on understanding their advantages, disadvantages, principles, steps, and applications without delving too deeply into mathematical formulas; Learn the step-by-step modeling process, e.g., CRISP-DM; Learn modeling tools, e.g., scikit-learn; Practice on small datasets, e.g., the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository; Deploy serialized or packaged models as a Flask API or Streamlit\\Gradio application; Supplementary Content:\nLearn about Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools. Learn about Python libraries for handling large datasets.
